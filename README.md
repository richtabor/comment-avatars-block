# Comment Avatars Block

[![Create Release and Deploy to WordPress.org](https://github.com/richtabor/comment-avatars-block/actions/workflows/create-release-and-deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/richtabor/comment-avatars-block/actions/workflows/create-release-and-deploy.yml)

The Comment Avatars block dynamically displays your post's comment activity. Based on the comment status, it will display an "Add" link when there are no comments, show avatars of up to three recent commenters when comments exist, and display the total comment count to highlight discussion activity.
